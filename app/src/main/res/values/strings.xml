        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

       <p align="center"><h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</b></h2></p><br/>

       <p> <b>Q: What is Campus Karma?</b><br/>
           A: Campus Karma is the India’s first ever college based social networking site launch on 1800 HRS IST,02-10-2012,
           intended to offer a virtual campus environment. It was conceived and founded by a 22 years old Computer Science
           B-Tech final year student with primary aim of connecting the youth of India from all colleges irrespective of their courses,
           under the universal banner of virtual campus life. The site intends to pervade through the most zealous age group of college
           going students and is meant to juxtapose to corporeal college life,
           infusing it with a scintillating dimension of technology.</p>

        <p> <b>Q: Why is Campus Karma special?</b><br/>
            A: Campus Karma is social campus networking website, one of its kind.
            Its India’s first campus social network where our aim is to bring all the campuses of India on one social platform
            where students and professor can interact and share ideas, Study materials (but who cares). We will tell you the fun part.
            On Campus Karma you will get to interact with new students, get to know what’s going on other campuses in India,
            It can be any kind of Activity, Research, Fest, Workshop etc.</p>

        <p> <b>Q: What feature does Campus Karma have?</b><br/>
            A: Well as said before campus karma is one of its kinds. There are lots of feature which can’t be explained verbally,
            Just take your time and scroll around and you will come to know but we will surely give you a brief idea.
            We have an "EVENT" section where you will get to know about the workshop, fest and other kind of events that’s
            going to take place on different location in India.
            We have "GROUPS" where you will have your own college listed.
            You can update about your campus activities so that other can know what actually happens in your college.
            Suppose you are planning to visit to a fest of some campus but what to know about the previous year
            fest of that campus you can visit the college group and look for the pictures, videos or blogs in the group.
            Lastly we have "FILE" sharing section where one can share their study materials etc with others.
            It can be any kind of files like you assignments, research paper etc which will help others.</p>

        <p> <b>Q: How do I (Student) get benefited from Campus Karma?</b><br/>
            A: Other than the Event, Groups and File section as discussed above one can also get helped deciding
            which college they want to get admission. If you have few college in mind and confused which one to choose.
            You can visit that group and look for what kind of activities goes on in that campus and then you will know which
            campus has more masti.</p>

        <p> <b>Q: How do I (Teacher) help students on Campus Karma?</b><br/>
            A: Well it’s the most common problem for teachers to circulate study material to each and every student on campus.
            What you can do is upload it on our server and ask your student to download it from here.
            In that way you don’t have to keep a record of the entire students email id and also you
            don’t have to mail them multiple time in batches. One upload and that would be all.</p>

        <p> <b>Q: What’s the requirement to join Campus Karma?</b><br/>
            A: Nothing. Campus Karma is free to join. It’s the best place for active as well as pass out batches to stay
            connected to their campus. We have simple and easy signup process and we also have facebook connect
            option where their account will automatically created with few clicks.</p>
